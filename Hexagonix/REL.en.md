<div align="justify">

This is the first extensively tested and marked stable version of the system. Hexagonix H1 is also the basis of Andromeda H1. Many improvements have been made since previous versions of the system, which used series of numbers to identify versions. Version 1.2-beta, in the previous numbering, was improved and served as the basis for the development of the most stable version to date, the H1 version, the public release of the system. You can get that release [here](https://github.com/hexagonix/hexagonix/releases/tag/H1). This version will continue to be improved and changes will be made available continuously.

<summary align='left'>Hexagonix H2-dev.beta6</summary>

<div align="justify">

The H2-dev.beta6 version came to standardize a number of Hexagonix services, as well as enforce compliance in system fonts and comments. Most of the changes in this version are not visible to the user, but they are important to guarantee the stability of the system. See the most important changes:

* Improvements in the messages of the system utilities, especially in error messages;
* Fixes in the following system utilities:
  - [x] DOSsh;
  - [x] init;
  - [x] su;
  - [x] login;
* A definition error in su could lead to the utility crashing or not working, since it would try to load the default shell (sh) with the name sh.app;
* Complete removal of references to Andromeda, since the distribution was merged into Hexagonix (see Hexagonix H2-dev.beta1). Removal took place at:
  - Name of functions;
  - Name of variables and constants;
  - Comments;
* Improved manual pages for all utilities;
* Improved Hexagon online documentation;
* Changed the version name from "Vita Nova" to "VitaNova", preventing issues when checking the hostname generated during system build;
* Changed the formatting of the init services declaration.

- [x] Release date: 28/11/2022 (dd/mm/yyyy)
