## Stable versions released

<div align="justify">

Below you can have direct access to some versions that have become milestones in the distribution of the system and have access to summary information about them.

> :construction: Warning! On 10/19/2023, the Hexagon version was downgraded to v1.0.0. This is due to several system stability improvements and corrections, in addition to the correction of several bugs during the system's execution. Furthermore, new features added showed that the kernel is now approaching maturity and stability. Therefore, just like the H1 version, the next edition of the system will be released with a v1.0.0 kernel.

Many improvements have been made since previous versions of the system, which used series of numbers to identify versions. Version 1.2-beta, in the previous numbering, was improved and served as the basis for the development of the most stable version to date, the H1 version, the public release of the system. You can get that release [here](https://github.com/hexagonix/hexagonix/releases/tag/H1). This version will continue to be improved and changes will be made available continuously.

* Fixes in the following system utilities:
  - [x] DOSsh;
  - [x] init;
  - [x] su;
  - [x] login;
