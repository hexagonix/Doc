# Hexagonix graphical applications and utilities

<div align="center">

<img src="https://github.com/hexagonix/Doc/blob/main/Img/HexagonixSourceHeader.png">

</div>

In addition to the Unix-like utilities, Hexagonix comes with a number of graphical utilities that are not similar in implementation or usability to Unix utilities. These utilities, called `Andromeda-Apps` or `Hexagonix-Andromeda` utilities, add a new layer of personality over Hexagonix. So far, all utilities implement their own documentation. Therefore, there are no manuals for them (impossible to use the Unix `man` utility to get help).

Below is the license for use and redistribution of Hexagonix-Andromeda utilities.

## Included utilities

Below is a list of the main Hexagonix-Andromeda utilities available. More are to come!

#### Andromeda SHell (ASH)

Andromeda SHell, or simply ASH, was developed as an alternative to Hexagonix's default shell, sh. sh resembles what is expected in appearance and basic functionality of a Unix-like system. ASH has no such claim, and has and will receive functions that expand its capability and usefulness.

#### Calc

The calculator allows the user to perform basic calculations.

#### Power

The utility allows the user to easily shut down or restart the computer.

#### GFont

This utility allows you to interactively change the system's default graphic font.

#### Lyoko

Lyoko was developed as an IDE that allows the user to develop programs to run on the system. It allows you to edit code and manipulate it, as well as build and test the application. So far, it works together with the flat assembler Hexagonix edition [(fasmX)](https://github.com/hexagonix/fasm) to allow building applications.

#### Piano return Piano;

The return Piano; is an electronic keyboard that allows the user to play music by emitting selected notes.

#### Quartzo

Quartzo is a general purpose editor for Hexagonix.

#### Serial

This utility allows the user to send data via the serial port, acting as a terminal.
