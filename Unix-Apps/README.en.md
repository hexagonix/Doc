One of the most important components of Hexagonix is ​​Unix-Apps. This package includes several utilities commonly found on Unix-like systems such as Linux, FreeBSD and macOS.

The syntax of the Hexagonix utilities follows that found in `Version 7 UNIX` and FreeBSD versions, although it does not strive for precision in implementation. Whenever you get stuck using one of the Unix utilities, enter `utility --help`, `utility ?` or `man utility`.

Below you will find the license for the use and distribution of Hexagonix's Unix utilities.
